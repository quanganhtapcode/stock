## Valuation Models

### DCF (Discounted Cash Flow) Model
- Projects future Free Cash Flow to Firm (FCFF)
- Calculates terminal value using perpetual growth
- Discounts cash flows using WACC
- Subtracts net debt to get equity value

**Formula:**
```
Enterprise Value = Œ£(FCFF_t / (1 + WACC)^t) + Terminal Value
Equity Value = Enterprise Value - Net Debt
Share Value = Equity Value / Shares Outstanding
```

### FCFE (Free Cash Flow to Equity) Model
- Projects Free Cash Flow to Equity directly
- Uses required return on equity as discount rate
- No need to subtract debt (already equity cash flow)

**Formula:**
```
Equity Value = Œ£(FCFE_t / (1 + Required Return)^t) + Terminal Value
Share Value = Equity Value / Shares Outstanding
```
